Cache-Memcached-PDeque

This is an implementation of a double-ended queue, with support for priorities.

A double-ended queue, abbreviated to deque, is an abstract data type that
combines the functionality of a queue and a stack, allowing elements to be added
to, and removed from, both the front and the back.

In addition, this implementation adds support for associating a priority with an
element, making it possible to serve elements with a higher priority before
elements with a lower priority.

The storage backend for this implementation is Memcached, an in-memory key-
value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects).
Cache::Memecached::Fast is used for access to Memcached.
